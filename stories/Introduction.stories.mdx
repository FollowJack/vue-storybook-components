# Vue Components Playbook

> **currently in BETA**.

With the component playbook, we want to simplify development. This library of reusable components and guidelines helps you with development.

## Our vision

DevParadise started Vue Component Playbook to make contributing to great development experience as easy as possible for developers and community members of all fields.
We want to create a component library that results in:

- Understanding of how each component works and how you can use it to create a great user experience.
- Short development times and consistent code quality.
- A beautiful, visually consistent TailwindCSS experience.
- Transparency about how we work and what we do.

## Get started

- **Explore UI components**
  Click on any of the component in the sidebar to see how they look, and how to configure them.
  Each component pages contains documentation of its properties, as well as code examples for how to use it.
- **Try them out**
  - Experiment with different properties, by clicking **Canvas** at the top of each component page.
  - Change the properties under **Controls** in the bottom panel.
  - See the emitted events under **Actions** in the bottom panel.
- **Use them**
  Once you've found the right component for your use case, click the **Story** tab to see the code implementation, or look at examples under **Docs**.

## Usage

You can either copy this project and adapt it to your needs,
or you just simply copy and paste the relevant code out of the github and adapt it to your needs,
or just look up on how to develop for instance a modal component :)

We use TailwindCSS and composition API. You can overwrite them with what ever is best suited for your project.

## Code Style Guide

For the structure of our components we use [atomic design pattern](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

Styling is done by [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) only classes. We added some small extra tailwind classes that you can look up in the `tailwind.config.js`.
We try to keep it simple and not introduced unecessary boilerplate.
